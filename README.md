# 🚀 Taquito Test dApp

> **Test dApp demonstrating Tezos blockchain interactions with visual diagrams and examples**

## Why this exists

The Taquito Test dApp is how we validate that [Taquito](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taquito) actually works; not just in unit tests, but in real browser environments with real wallets on real testnets.

**For the Taquito team**, it's our hands-on proving ground. Every release, we use this to verify the developer experience is solid and operations behave as expected.

**For developers**, it's runnable documentation. Instead of copy-pasting snippets and hoping they work, you can see exactly how Taquito operations flow (transfers, contract calls, staking, bridging) with visual diagrams showing each step.

**For wallet teams**, it's a quick interoperability check. Connect via Beacon or WalletConnect and validate your wallet's UX against real Tezos operations without building a test harness from scratch.

**For the ecosystem**, it lowers the barrier to testnet participation. The more people experimenting on testnets, the healthier those networks are. An unused testnet is a wasted testnet.

We consider this a **public good**. Our goal is to have a deployment ready on every new testnet as it launches.
