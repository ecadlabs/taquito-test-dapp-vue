# Sapling Test Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the Sapling private transactions test that has been added to the Taquito test dApp.

## What Was Added

### 1. Dependencies (package.json)

- `@taquito/sapling@^23.0.0` - Taquito Sapling protocol support
- `bip39@^3.1.0` - BIP39 mnemonic support for key generation

### 2. Smart Contracts (src/contracts/sapling-contracts.ts)

- **`singleSaplingStateContract(memoSize)`** - Single Sapling pool contract for basic shield/transfer/unshield operations
- **`saplingContractDouble`** - Multi-state contract with two independent Sapling pools (for future expansion)

### 3. Test Module (src/modules/tests/tests/sapling/sapling-single-state.ts)

Core functionality implementing:

- Contract deployment
- Spending key and viewing key generation for Alice and Bob
- Shield operation: 3 ℸ from public to private
- Private transfer: 2 ℸ from Alice to Bob (completely confidential)
- Unshield operation: 1 ℸ from private to public
- Balance verification after each operation
- Progress callback for UI updates

**Key Features:**

- Generates unique keys for each test run via BIP39 mnemonics
- Uses RPC read adapter for balance queries
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Provides real-time progress updates

### 4. Vue Component (src/modules/tests/tests/sapling/sapling-single-state.vue)

Beautiful, user-friendly interface featuring:

- **Informational Banner**: Explains Sapling protocol and performance expectations
- **Progress Tracker**: Real-time status of each operation (pending/success/error)
- **Results Display**: Shows contract address and all generated Sapling addresses with copy buttons
- **Operation Summary**: Detailed results including transaction hashes and balances
- **Run Controls**: Primary button to start test, secondary button to run again

**UI Highlights:**

- Color-coded progress indicators (blue = pending, green = success, red = error)
- Spinning loader animation during CPU-intensive proof generation
- Copy-to-clipboard for contract and wallet addresses
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### 5. Test Registration (src/modules/tests/tests.ts)

Added comprehensive metadata for the Sapling test:

- Test ID: `sapling-single-state`
- Category: Cryptography & Security
- Clear setup requirements and warnings about proof generation time
- Links to Taquito and Tezos documentation
- Visual flow diagram showing all 8 steps
- Related tests: transfer, sign-payload, counter-contract

### 6. Documentation (src/modules/tests/tests/sapling/README.md)

Complete reference guide covering:

- Overview of Sapling protocol
- File descriptions and structure
- Key concepts (spending keys, viewing keys, payment addresses, memos)
- Detailed operation flows (shield → transfer → unshield)
- Performance considerations and hardware requirements
- Security best practices and warnings
- Browser compatibility matrix
- Network support information
- Troubleshooting guide
- API reference for developers
- References to official documentation
- Future enhancement ideas

## How It Works

### User Workflow

1. **Connect Wallet**: User connects their Tezos wallet (Temple, Kukai, etc.)
2. **View Test**: Navigate to the "Sapling: Private Transactions" test under Cryptography & Security
3. **Start Test**: Click "Run Sapling Test" button
4. **Watch Progress**:
   - Contract deployment (5-10 seconds)
   - Key generation (instant)
   - Shield operation (15-30 seconds due to proof generation)
   - Private transfer (15-30 seconds due to proof generation)
   - Unshield operation (15-30 seconds due to proof generation)
5. **View Results**: See contract address, wallet addresses, balances, and transaction hashes

### Technical Flow

```
1. Deploy Sapling Contract (generates unique contract address)
   ↓
2. Generate Keys
   ├── Alice: spending key + viewing key + payment address (zet...)
   └── Bob: spending key + viewing key + payment address (zet...)
   ↓
3. Shield: Public Account → Alice's Sapling Address (3 ℸ)
   ├── Generate zero-knowledge proof (~15-30 seconds)
   ├── Submit transaction
   └── Verify Alice's balance = 3 ℸ
   ↓
4. Transfer: Alice's Address → Bob's Address (2 ℸ privately)
   ├── Generate zero-knowledge proof (~15-30 seconds)
   ├── Submit transaction (completely private on blockchain)
   └── Verify Alice: 1 ℸ, Bob: 2 ℸ
   ↓
5. Unshield: Alice's Sapling Address → Public Account (1 ℸ)
   ├── Generate zero-knowledge proof (~15-30 seconds)
   ├── Submit transaction
   └── Verify Alice: 0 ℸ
   ↓
6. Return Results with all details
```

## Network Requirements

- **Recommended**: Ghostnet (newest testnet with Sapling support)
- **Also Supported**: Seoulnet, Shadownet, Mainnet
- **Requires**: Protocol 015 (Edo) or later

## Performance Expectations

| Operation                        | Duration          | CPU Impact    |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Proof Generation (per operation) | 10-30 seconds     | Very High     |
| Contract Deployment              | 5-10 seconds      | Medium        |
| Key Generation                   | <1 second         | Low           |
| Balance Verification             | <1 second         | Low           |
| **Total Test Runtime**           | **40-95 seconds** | **Very High** |

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Status         | Notes                |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Chrome  | ✅ Recommended | Best performance     |
| Firefox | ✅ Recommended | Full support         |
| Edge    | ✅ Good        | Works well           |
| Safari  | ⚠️ Limited     | May have WASM issues |

## Security Notes

### What This Test Does NOT Do

- Does not store private keys
- Does not require user to input spending keys
- Does not expose sensitive information
- Does not persist data after completion

### What Users Should Know

- All spending keys are generated fresh for each test
- Viewing keys can be safely shared with others
- Payment addresses (zet...) are safe to publicize
- Never share your real spending keys with anyone

### Production Considerations

When implementing Sapling in a real application:

1. Never log or display spending keys
2. Use secure key storage (e.g., hardware wallets)
3. Warn users about proof generation time
4. Handle network timeouts gracefully
5. Provide clear error messages

## Testing the Implementation

### Local Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to: http://localhost:5173
# Connect wallet
# Go to "Cryptography & Security" → "Sapling: Private Transactions"
# Click "Run Sapling Test"
```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test on Ghostnet (recommended)
- [ ] Test on Seoulnet
- [ ] Verify contract deploys successfully
- [ ] Verify shield operation completes in expected time
- [ ] Verify private transfer is not visible on block explorer
- [ ] Verify unshield operation returns funds
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- [ ] Test on mobile device (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify responsive design works
- [ ] Test with insufficient balance (should fail gracefully)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Tests

- **Sapling Multiple States** - Test contracts with independent Sapling pools
- **Batched Operations** - Combine multiple operations in single transaction
- **Proving Key Mode** - Use proving keys for hardware wallet scenarios

### Potential Features

- Sapling address book for common recipients
- Transaction history viewer with spent/unspent status
- Custom memo size support
- Sapling address validator utility
- QR code generation for payment addresses
- Visual fund flow diagram
- Multi-recipient operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Proof generation is taking too long"**

- Normal behavior! Proof generation is CPU-intensive
- Wait 20-30 seconds for each operation
- Use a faster computer for quicker results

**"WASM module failed to load"**

- Clear browser cache and reload
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- Check network connectivity
- Update your browser to the latest version

**"Insufficient balance"**

- Use the faucet to fund your wallet with testnet Tez
- Minimum ~5 ℸ recommended for gas fees
- Wait for previous operations to confirm before running test again

**"Contract deployment failed"**

- Check network connection
- Verify you're on Ghostnet or supported network
- Try again - may be temporary network issue
